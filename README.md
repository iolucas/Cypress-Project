# Cypress Project

## ðŸš€ What is this project about?

This is a Cypress project developed by me, Lucas, with the assistance of online classes that I took through this period (2023/2). Cypress is a JavaScript-based testing framework for web applications. It allows me to write end-to-end tests for my applicationâ€™s UI and APIs.

## ðŸ§ª What did I learn from this project?

In this project, I learned how to work with APIs using Cypress, which is a powerful and convenient way to test the communication and integration between different parts of my web application. I also learned how to use Cypress features such as mocking, time travel, spies, stubs, and clocks to verify and control the behavior of my application.

## ðŸ“ˆ How did this project help me improve?

This project helped me improve my skills and knowledge in web development and testing. I gained more confidence and experience in writing and running tests for my web application. I also learned how to use Cypress tools and documentation to solve problems and debug issues.
