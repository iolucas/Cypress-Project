# Cypress Project

This is a Cypress project developed by me, Lucas, with the assistance of online classes that I took through this period (2023/2). Cypress is a JavaScript-based testing framework for web applications. It allows me to write end-to-end tests for the applicationâ€™s UI and APIs. In this project, I learned how to work with APIs using Cypress, which is a powerful and convenient way to test the communication and integration between different parts of the web application. I also learned how to use Cypress features such as mocking, time travel, spies, stubs, and clocks to verify and control the behavior of my application. This project helped me improve my skills and knowledge in web development and testing.
